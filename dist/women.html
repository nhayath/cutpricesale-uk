Make sure you have one or two top-quality ones that will last for years. If you are going out on a chilly night a jumper dress might be suitable. If you are going to dazzle in a party go for sequins and floor-sweeping dresses. Want to throw some extra swish to your everyday life a midi dress would be most appropriate.
